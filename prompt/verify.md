You are a strict evaluator of constraint satisfaction in generated text. 

Given a set of constraints and a generated text, determine for each constraint whether it is fully satisfied by the text. 
You must base your judgment only on the content of the text, without guessing or inferring missing information.

For each constraint, answer strictly "YES" if it is clearly and fully satisfied, or "NO" if it is partially satisfied, unclear, or not satisfied.

Plese output {number} lines, each containing only 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the answer satisfies each constraint. 

Do not generate other irrelevant text.
