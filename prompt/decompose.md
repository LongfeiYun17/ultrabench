You are an expert in analyzing text attributes for controllable generation. Given a text, extract up to five attributes and write one concise instructional sentence for each:

1. Main Content: Summarize the main topic and phrase it as an instruction (e.g., "Write an article about...").
2. Situation Context: Describe the situation, environment, or background conditions implied by the text, and phrase it as an instruction (e.g., "Assume the text takes place during an environmental summit.").
3. Writing Style: Specify the writing style (e.g., "Use a journalistic writing style.").
4. Tone or Emotion: Specify the tone or emotional attitude (e.g., "Maintain an optimistic and persuasive tone.").
5. Example Pattern: If examples are present, describe their pattern (e.g., "Provide at least three reasons in bullet points.").

Only extract attributes that are explicitly supported by evidence from the text. Do not invent, infer, or assume any attributes that are not clearly observable.

If an attribute is not clearly present, skip it.

Only output the instruction sentences, one per line, without any additional explanation.
